<!-- 1. This example was created from this tutorial:
https://xtrp.io/blog/2020/11/20/generating-the-sierpinski-triangle-in-vanilla-javascript-with-html5-canvas/ 
- This was started 07/15/21 for about 1hr and 30min-->

<!-- I can have users input values for starting pos and sidelen for the Sierpinski Triangle function: that would serve as two controls on the page. Then those values inputted from the form in the html would be sent to the document.ready function and ultimately be passed into the correct function. Another value that could be inputted by the user is the depth, giving them the freedom to choose how much they want their fractal to repeat. Depth refers to the base case in the recursive function. Once Depth reaches 0, the function breaks out of it's loop. -->

Fractal Patterns to implement:
- Sierpinski Triangle
    Example 5: Sierpinski triangle
    The Sierpinski triangle drawn using an L-system.

    variables : F G
    constants : + −
    start  : F−G−G
    rules  : (F → F−G+F+G−F), (G → GG)
    angle  : 120°
    Here, F means "draw forward", G means "draw forward", + means "turn left by angle", and − means "turn right by angle".

- Koch Curves
    Example 4: Koch curve
    A variant of the Koch curve which uses only right angles.

    variables : F
    constants : + −
    start  : F
    rules  : (F → F+F−F−F+F)
    Here, F means "draw forward", + means "turn left 90°", and − means "turn right 90°" (see turtle graphics).

- Mandelbrot Set (maybe, this one is more complex than the others)

- What is the Cantor Set? Is this also another fractal pattern?
    Example 3: Cantor set
    Cantor set in seven iterations.svg
    variables : A B
    constants : none
    start  : A {starting character string}
    rules  : (A → ABA), (B → BBB)
    Let A mean "draw forward" and B mean "move forward".

    This produces the famous Cantor's fractal set on a real straight line R.

- Pythagoras Tree 
 

    Example 6: Dragon curve
    The dragon curve drawn using an L-system.

    variables : F G
    constants : + −
    start  : F
    rules  : (F → F+G), (G → F-G)
    angle  : 90°
    Here, F and G both mean "draw forward", + means "turn left by angle", and − means "turn right by angle".
  
  - Here is a bunch of resources on Botanical patterns I found as well:
  http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/
  
    Example 7: Fractal plant
    See also: Barnsley fern
    variables : X F
    constants : + − [ ]
    start  : X
    rules  : (X → F+[[X]-X]-F[-FX]+X), (F → FF)
    angle  : 25°
    Here, F means "draw forward", − means "turn right 25°", and + means "turn left 25°". X does not correspond to any drawing action and is used to control the evolution of the curve. The square bracket "[" corresponds to saving the current values for position and angle, which are restored when the corresponding "]" is executed. -->

<!-- 4. Reading on Canvas Element in HTML 5, as well as other fractal generators to get some ideas for features:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html5/html5_canvas.htm

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API

https://aiartists.org/fractal-art-generators 
^ I would want my fractal generator to look something like the first one maybe. How do I get the application to have 3D rendering with quick animation for inspecting the fractal? -->

<!-- 5. Find Resources/Books on Best Fractal Generators article on how to build such applications (acquired both books):

- The Nature of Code: Simulating Natural Systems with Processing by Daniel Shiffman (https://www.amazon.com/Nature-Code-Simulating-Natural-Processing/dp/0985930802/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=petekistler-20&linkId=7c493c7796a83424489af045de000453&language=en_US)
^ this book talks about using Processing, so that will have to be a decision I make on whether to use Canvas or Processing to render and create the fractals!

- Fractals: Form, Chance and Dimension by Benoit B. Mandelbrot (https://www.amazon.com/Fractals-Dimension-Benoit-B-Mandelbrot/dp/1635619025?dchild=1&qid=1614641188&refinements=p_27:Benoit+B.+Mandelbrot&s=books&sr=1-1&text=Benoit+B.+Mandelbrot&linkCode=sl1&tag=petekistler-20&linkId=1c296b54ad1ed71cae6187f868f98d6a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)
