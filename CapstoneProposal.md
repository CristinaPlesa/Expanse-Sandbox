# Name of Student: Cristina Plesa

# Name of Project: Expanse

## Project's Purpose or Goal: Users can adjust different controls in the application to create their own unique fractals.

### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

* Design a dynamic webpage that holds a number of controls to adjust:
1. Color
2. Graphing Points for 2D or 3D graphic creation
3. Ability to change the size of the fractal or fractal branches
4. Depth refers to the implementation of 3D rendering for fractals
5. Controls to Zoom in and inspect created fractal

### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

* React for dynamic page capability
* HTML5Canvas or Processing for implementation of the fractal graphics
* C# for the backend building of the application or database for saving fractal data

### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

* Users can register accounts and save fractal data
* Implement world-creation capability with fractals. So, possibly applying procedural generation to a 2D/3D canvas in order to generate spherical fractal worlds.

### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

* I am not completely sure. I think more research needs to go into what is needed for my project.
* I think for user capability, I would need to use Identity with C#. 
* L-system or Lindenmayer system
